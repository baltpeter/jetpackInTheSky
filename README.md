Simple Game in HaXe using the HaxeFlixel library
It's basically one of those Inifinite Runner style games where the main character is for some reason "trapped" and has to run until he tumbles to death ;)

Programming Practices
---------------------
Yes, I know. My code doesn't really use all the best programming practices. E.g., I could've used an FlxGroup for the platforms. However, this is really just my first game in HaXe and more of a tryout.
I might change this in the future, but for now I will stick to "quick 'n' dirty". Hopefully, there's still something you can use for your own projects.

Sources
-------
As I mentioned earlier, this was my first HaXe game. Thus, some parts of this are based on tutorials - both from "real" HaxeFlixel and Flixel ones.
I will list a few here, in case I forgot one, I'm sorry. Please contact me so I can add them...
